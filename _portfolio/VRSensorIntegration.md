collection: portfolio
excerpt: 'This is a set of free online tutorials on integrating physiological sensing into virtual reality applications. These tutorials are intended for a wide audience — from health care professionals who have little background in programming, to software developers who have little background in wearable health sensors, and finally to any students looking to find a niche in these rapidly expanding fields. I was the team lead on this project, and wrote much of the documentation, example code, and was responsible for the site design and layout.'
