I am a PhD Computer Science student at Wright State University performing research with the Terascale All-Sensing Research Studio (TARS) laboratory under the advisement of Doctors Sean and Natasha Banerjee. My research focuses on virtual reality and phyisiological sensing, their intersection and how they can improve application design and fluidity when integrated together. Outside of research, I am a pianist and enjoy reading, working out, and watching movies.

Experience
============
*R&D Co-op* <br />
Delsys, Inc. <br/>
May 2025 - August 2025 <br/>
* During my time at Delsys I will contribute to the development of software and
algorithm design for applications in the realm of contact and non-contact physiology,
computer vision, and body movement tracking.

*Graduate Research Assistant* <br />
Clarkson University <br />
January 2024 - July 2024 <br />
* Created *VRmonic*, a Piano Trainer designed to reduce repetitive strain injuries by giving feedback on user playing form in comparison to an experts. Published and demoed this work at IEEE AIxVR 2024.
* Began work on *VRSensorIntegration*, an end-to-end set of online tutorials designed to teach users how to integrate physiological sensors with virtual reality and conduct data collection.

*Graduate Research Assistant* <br />
Wright State University <br />
August 2024 - Present <br />
* Finished work on *VRSensorIntegration*, which was workshopped in the UK and India to a wide demographic of attendees, including computer scientists, professors, healthcare workers, students, and entrepeneurs.
* Created *VitaMaze, a VR exergame utilizing sEMG and Heart Rate sensors to control avatar motion in-game. Published this work at IEEE AIxVR 2025.
* Created a VR maze exergame that used surface electromyography sensors and heart rate sensors to incentivize play and provide in-game feedback from physiological signals. Demoed this work at IEEE CVPR 2024.
* Student Volunteered at IEEE RO-MAN 2024 and demoed robotic physiological sensor integration.
* Mentored undergraduate students joining the lab, including nontraditional undergraduate students.
* Attended CITI training for large-scale human studies and wrote IRB protocol for an upcoming robotics study.

*Technology Intern* <br />
Hilton Central School District <br />
May 2023 - August 2023 <br />
* Prepared teachers and students for new school year by teaching them how to use new technologies.
* Set up classrooms for summer school and collected returned technology.
* Troubleshot technology issues for a large school district with multiple buildings and over 1000 students.
