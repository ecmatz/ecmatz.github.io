Hi, I'm Ethan. I am an MS Computer Science student at Wright State University performing research with the Terascale All-Sensing Research Studio (TARS) laboratory under the advisement of Doctors Sean and Natasha Banerjee. My research focuses on a mix between software and hardware integration, including but not limited to physiological sensing, virtual reality, application development, and robotics.

Experience
============
*R&D Co-op* <br />
Delsys, Inc. <br/>
May 2025 - August 2025 <br/>
* During my time at Delsys I have contributed to the development of software and algorithm design for applications in the realm of contact and non-contact physiology, computer vision, and body movement tracking. I also support our end users with troubleshooting, troubleshooting software and hardware issues, synchronizing devices and, and performing Bash and Python scripting on Linux and Windows.

*Graduate Research Assistant* <br />
Clarkson University <br />
January 2024 - July 2024 <br />
* Created *VRmonic*, a Piano Trainer designed to reduce repetitive strain injuries by giving feedback on user playing form in comparison to an experts. Published and demoed this work at IEEE AIxVR 2024.
* Began work on *VRSensorIntegration*, an end-to-end set of online tutorials designed to teach users how to integrate physiological sensors with virtual reality and conduct data collection.

*Graduate Research Assistant* <br />
Wright State University <br />
August 2024 - Present <br />
* Finished work on *VRSensorIntegration*, which was workshopped in the UK and India to a wide demographic of attendees, including computer scientists, professors, healthcare workers, students, and entrepeneurs.
* Created *VitaMaze*, a VR exergame utilizing sEMG and Heart Rate sensors to control avatar motion in-game. Published this work at IEEE AIxVR 2025.
* Created a VR maze exergame that used surface electromyography sensors and heart rate sensors to incentivize play and provide in-game feedback from physiological signals. Demoed this work at IEEE CVPR 2024.
* Student Volunteered at IEEE RO-MAN 2024 and demoed robotic physiological sensor integration.
* Mentored undergraduate students joining the lab, including nontraditional undergraduate students.
* Attended CITI training for large-scale human studies and wrote IRB protocol for an upcoming robotics study.
* Created *VRRobot*, a computer vision application using an Orbbec camera to track user gestures using Mediapipe and control a robotic arm in VR.

*Technology Intern* <br />
Hilton Central School District <br />
May 2023 - August 2023 <br />
* Prepared teachers and students for new school year by teaching them how to use new technologies.
* Set up classrooms for summer school and collected returned technology.
* Troubleshot technology issues for a large school district with multiple buildings and over 1000 students.
* Set up active directory services on student chromebooks and configured them for use in the district.
* Wired patch cables to connect classrooms to the server network.
* Helped diagnose hardware issues on a variety of PC models.

*Computer Builder* <br />
Self Employed <br />
November 2019 - June 2021 <br />
* Built office desktops and gaming systems for friends and people in the town of Livonia, NY.
* Developed skills in tracking market prices, comparing specifications, and understanding computer parts.
* Learned how to negotiate with customers, balance expectations and requests, and find compromises.
* Sourced parts for different levels of PC builds, from workstations to racing rigs.
